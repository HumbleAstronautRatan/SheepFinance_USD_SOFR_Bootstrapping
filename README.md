# USD_SOFR_Bootstrapping
Post IBOR transition the Federal Reserve Bank published overnight SOFR rates (Par Rates) now considered benchmark Rates for USD Swaps. For Risk valuations, it is appreciated that one shall use Zero Rates derived from the above.
The idea is simple, assume a Vanilla interest rate Swap deal with the usual fixed and floating leg, The process of identifying the rate that makes the fixed and float leg equal is called bootstrapping, and the solved rate is called Zero Rate.
